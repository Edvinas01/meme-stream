# Contributing

To contribute, first fork and clone the repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:username/meme-stream.git
```

Navigate to project directory and set it up (this command might take some time):
```
./gradlew build
```

If you're on Windows:
```
gradlew.bat build
```

Then make your changes, test them out and submit your pull request.

Some things to consider:
* No code style is enforced as long as existing files are not altered.
* Tests are not required but are welcome.
